The legal framework for protection of personal data in EU will be changed 
from [Directive 95/46/EC][95-46-EC] to [General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR)][GDPR] that will come into force on 25 May 2018.

It was a big challenge for me to make my plugin complied with this regulation,
because this plugin records IP address which is considered as [personal data]
[PERSONAL-DATA] into its logs and cache on the database.

The main topic of this release note is to describe how this plugin was changed 
to meet the GDPR compliance.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> As I'm not a lawyer nor a jurist, I do not 
	intend to provide you legal basis. In this article I only provides you 
	nothing more than my technical and functional interpretation regarding 
	the requirements of the GDPR.

#### Legitimate interest ####

It goes without saying that analysis of access log is important for security.
Apart from being able to directly or automatically identify the malice of the 
requested data, the footprints in the log can help not only to identify the 
security breach but also to manually analyze malicious intention and to block 
such requests.

While GDPR requires explicit consent of "Data Subject" for sensitive personal 
data or unambiguous consent for non-sensitive data, getting consent to record 
access log before responding does not make sense especially when attackers use 
some tool to compromise the website.

GDPR states about such a case as "[Legitimate interest][LEGITIMATE]" for 
specific purpose of processing. [GDPREU.org][GDPREU.ORG] says:

> _Beyond Recital 47 stating that fraud prevention "constitutes a legitimate 
> interest", Recital 49 states that **the necessary and proportionate processing
> for network security** "constitutes a legitimate interest"_

The Recital 49 states:

> _The processing of personal data to the extent **strictly necessary and 
> proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security**_

Of course, recording access log should not override fundamental rights and 
freedoms of the data subject stated in "[Lawfulness of processing][LAWFULNESS]"
as follows:

> _(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
> pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests
> are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the 
> data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where
> the data subject is a child._

Therefore, I had to consider technical and functional requirements to meet 
GDPR compliance.

#### Technical requirements for GDPR ####

[GDPREU.org summarizes][KEY-CHANGES] the aim of GDPR and data subject rights 
to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches as follows:

- Breach Notification
- **Right to Access**
- **Right to be Forgotten**
- **Data Portability**
- **Privacy by Design**
- Data Protection Officers

I think the first right and the last one would not be related to the blocking 
functionality of this plugin. And for the rest of the rights, I have taken my 
interpretation down into the functions of this plugin as follows:

1. **Privacy and record settings**  
   All the settings related to personal data processing are now managed in 
   **Privacy and record settings** section. If you do not want to record any 
   IP addresses, you can disable **Record Statistics**, **Record Logs** and 
   **Record IP address cache** to definitely comply with GDPR.
   ![Privacy and record settings]({{ '/img/2018-05/PrivacySettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Privacy and record settings"
   )
   <div class="alert alert-info">
       <strong>Note:</strong> When <strong>Record IP address cache</strong> is
       disabled, limiting login attempts can not work.
   </div>

1. **Manage 3rd parties' API**  
   When you enable the option **Privacy friendly**, only the local geolocation 
   databases are used to get country code from IP address to prevent sending 
   sensitive data to the 3rd parties' API via HTTP.
   ![Geolocation API settings]({{ '/img/2018-05/GeolocationAPI.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Geolocation API settings"
   )

1. **Anonymize IP address**  
   In GDPR, this function is related to "**Pseudonymisation**" which is the 
   processing of personal data such that it can no longer be attributed to a 
   single data subject without the use of additional data, so long as said 
   additional data stays separate to ensure non-attribution.
   
   This function is for **Privacy by Design** in GDPR. When the option 
   **Privacy friendly** is enabled, IP address in logs / cache is anonymized 
   with three asterisks `***`.
   
   ![Validation logs with anonymized IP address]({{ '/img/2018-05/ValidationLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Validation logs with anonymized IP address"
   )
   
   Even when **Privacy friendly** is enabled, you can access the 3rd parties' 
   API on **Search IP address geolocation**, but the last number of specified 
   IP address will be replaced to `0` like `123.456.789.0` to prevent 
   inadvertent sending personal data to the 3rd parties .
   
   ![Search IP address geolocation]({{ '/img/2018-05/SearchAddress.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Search IP address geolocation"
   )

1. **Encrypt IP address**  
   IP address in logs / cache is now always encrypted by [AES][AES-ENCRYPT] to 
   prepare for personal data breach. This is also for **Privacy by Design**.
   
   ![Encrypted IP Address in cache]({{ '/img/2018-05/EncryptedAddress.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Encrypted IP Address in cache"
   )

1. **Remove entries by IP address**  
   This is related to **Right to Access** and **Right to be Forgotten**.
   
   ![Remove entries by IP address]({{ '/img/2018-05/BulkAction.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Remove entries by IP address"
   )

1. **Export logs by csv**  
   This function is for logs / cache and just for **Right to Access** and 
   **Data Portability**.

1. **Log rotation**  
   [Log rotation][LOG-ROTATION] is an automated processing that erases outdated
   data which seems to be related to **Right to be Forgotten**. The entries in 
   logs and cache in this plugin will be removed when exceeded a certain amount
   / time.

#### Thought about the balance ####

Needless to say that all website administrators need to monitor, detect, 
protect and respond to the security matters such as intrusion, hacking, 
hijacking, data breaches and so on, to protect property of stakeholders 
including website visitors and customers. And also I believe personal data 
should be protected as GDPR requires <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f510.png)
</span>.

To achieve both of them, the balance between them is most important. So for 
those purpose, I wish I could provide some technological solution to contribute
to WordPress community.

Of course Iâ€™m not a lawyer nor a jurist <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f393.png)
</span> as I stated at the beginning of this article. So any advices and 
discussions will be appreciated <span class="emoji">

### Update of Geolocation APIs ###

[freegeoip.net][FREEGEOIP.NET] make a fresh start as [ipstack.com][IPSTACK.COM]
and it needs API key available "[Get Free API Key][GET-API-KEY]" to use even 
for free.

Another API by [Xhanch][XHANCH] was dropped because it supports only IPv4. 
Instead of this, a new comer [Ipdata.co][IPDATA.CO] is now introduced. You can 
make upto 1500 requests daily via HTTPS for free. And the most unique feature 
is "Threat intelligence Data" that can identify 600M malicious IP addresses, 
open proxies, tor nodes, spammers, botnets, attackers and so on.
