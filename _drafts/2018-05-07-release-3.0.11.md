Protection of personal data has been changed from [Directive 95/46/EC][95-46-EC]
to [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)][GDPR] that will come into force 
on 25 May 2018. It was a big challenge for me to make this plugin complied with 
this regulation, because this plugin records IP address which is considered 
as [personal data][PERSONAL-DATA] into its logs and cache on the database.

The main topic of this release note is to describe how this plugin was changed 
to meet the GDPR compliance.

	more than my technical and functional interpretation regarding the 
	requirements of the GDPR.

### Legitimate interest ###

It goes without saying audit logs are important to security. Apart from being 
able to directly or automatically determine the malice of the requested data, 
audit logs are can help not only to identify security breach but also to 
analyze malicious intention manually and to block such requests.

While GDPR requires explicit consent of "Data Subject" for sensitive personal 
data or unambiguous consent for non-sensitive data, getting consent to record 
audit logs before accepting the requests does not make sense especially when 
attackers use some tool to compromise the website.

GDPR states such a case as "[Legitimate interest][LEGITIMATE]" for the purpose 
of processing. [GDPREU.org][GDPREU.ORG] says:

> Beyond Recital 47 stating that fraud prevention "constitutes a legitimate 
> interest", Recital 49 states that the necessary and proportionate processing 
> for network security "constitutes a legitimate interest"

The Recital 49 states:

> The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and 
> proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security

Of course, recording audit logs should not override fundamental rights and 
freedoms of the data subject stated in "[Lawfulness of processing][LAWFULNESS]"
as follows:

> (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
> pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests
> are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the 
> data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where
> the data subject is a child.

Therefore, I had to consider technical and functional requirements to meet 
GDPR compliance.

### Technical requirements by GDPR ###

[GDPREU.org summarizes][KEY-CHANGES] the aim of GDPR and data subject rights 
to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches as follows:

- Breach Notification
- **Right to Access**
- **Right to be Forgotten**
- **Data Portability**
- **Privacy by Design**
- Data Protection Officers

I think the first right and the last one would not be related to the blocking 
functionality that is the main purpose of this plugin. And for the rest of the 
rights, I have taken my interpretation down into the functions of this plugin 
as follows:

1. **Privacy and record settings**  
   All the settings related to privacy data processing are now managed in 
   **Privacy and record settings**. If you do not want to record any IP 
   addresses, you can disable **Record Statistics**, **Record Logs** and 
   **Record IP address cache** to definitely comply with GDPR.
   ![Privacy and record settings]({{ '/img/2018-05/PrivacySettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Privacy and record settings"
   )

1. **Manage 3rd parties' API**  
   When you enable the option **Privacy friendly**, only the local databases 
   is be used to get country code from IP address to prevent sending it to 3rd 
   parties' API via HTTP.
   ![Geolocation API settings]({{ '/img/2018-05/GeolocationAPI.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Geolocation API settings"
   )

1. **Anonymize IP address**  
   IP address in logs / cache is anonymized with three asterisks `***` when 
   **Privacy friendly** is enabled. This function is for **Privacy by Design**.
   
   In GDPR, this function is related to "**Pseudonymisation**" which is the 
   processing of personal data such that it can no longer be attributed to a 
   single data subject without the use of additional data, so long as said 
   additional data stays separate to ensure non-attribution.
   ![Validation logs with anonymized IP address]({{ '/img/2018-05/ValidationLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Validation logs with anonymized IP address"
   )
   Even when **Privacy friendly** is enabled, you can access the 3rd parties' 
   API on **Search IP address geolocation**, but the last number of specified 
   IP address will be replaced to `0` like `123.456.789.0` to prevent sending 
   personal data to the 3rd parties accidentally.
   ![Search IP address geolocation]({{ '/img/2018-05/SearchAddress.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Search IP address geolocation"
   )

1. **Encrypt IP address**  
   IP address in logs / cache is now always encrypted by [AES][AES-ENCRYPT] to 
   prepare for personal data breach. This is also for **Privacy by Design**.
   ![Encrypted IP Address in cache]({{ '/img/2018-05/EncryptedAddress.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Encrypted IP Address in cache"
   )

1. **Remove entries by IP address**  
   This is related to **Right to Access** and **Right to be Forgotten**.
   ![Remove entries by IP address]({{ '/img/2018-05/BulkAction.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    "Remove entries by IP address"
   )

1. **Export logs by csv**  
   This function is for logs / cache and just for **Right to Access** and 
   **Data Portability**.

1. **Log rotation**  
   [Log rotation][LOG-ROTATION] is an automated processing that erases outdated
   data which is related to **Right to be Forgotten**. The entries in logs and 
   cache in this plugin will be removed when exceeded a certain amount / time.

### Closing thought ###

Needless to say that all website administrators need to monitor, detect, 
protect and respond to security matters such as intrusion, hacking, hijacking, 
data breaches and so on, to protect property of stakeholders including website 
visitors and customers. And I also believe personal data should be protected as
GDPR requires <span class="emoji">

</span>.

To achieve both of them, the balance between them is most important. And I hope
I could provide the solution.

But Iâ€™m not a lawyer nor a jurist <span class="emoji">

</span> as I stated at the beginning of this article. So any advices and 
discussions will be appreciated <span class="emoji">
